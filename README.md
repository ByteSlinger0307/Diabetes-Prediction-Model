# Diabetes Prediction Model

A machine learning project designed to predict the onset of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics. This model is built using Python and popular data science libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Description

This project aims to utilize a supervised learning approach to predict whether a person has diabetes based on input features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and more. The model helps to identify individuals at risk and provides insights that could assist in early intervention.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ByteSlinger0307/Diabetes-Prediction-Model.git
    cd Diabetes-Prediction-Model
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various health metrics that are critical indicators of diabetes. Please ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to use the data if it is not included in this repository.

## Model
The model uses features like glucose level, BMI, age, etc., to predict the likelihood of diabetes. Different machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated to select the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Steps Involved

The project follows a systematic approach to build a reliable diabetes prediction model. Below are the detailed steps involved:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered a dataset containing various health-related metrics that are significant predictors of diabetes.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values by imputation or removal, depending on the context.
   - Normalized and scaled the features to ensure that the model training is effective and that the data is consistent.
   - Encoded categorical variables, if any, to numerical values for model compatibility.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution, correlations, and potential outliers.
   - Visualized the data using plots like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify patterns and relationships between variables.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - Used statistical methods and domain knowledge to select the most relevant features for model training.
   - Applied techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance from tree-based models, or recursive feature elimination.

5. **Model Selection:**
   - Experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
   - Implemented these algorithms using Python libraries such as scikit-learn.

6. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance.
   - Trained the models using the training dataset, tuning parameters to optimize performance.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score.
   - Compared the performance of different models to select the best one.

8. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to further improve the model's performance.

9. **Model Deployment (Optional):**
   - Considered steps for deploying the model using a platform like Flask for creating a simple API, or Docker for containerization, depending on the project scope.

10. **Documentation and Reporting:**
    - Documented the entire process, including the decisions made at each step, the performance metrics, and the final model selection.
    - Created visualizations and reports to summarize the findings and results.

11. **Future Work:**
    - Discussed potential improvements, such as trying different algorithms, incorporating more data, or enhancing feature engineering.

These steps ensure that the model is built systematically, with a strong foundation in both data handling and machine learning practices.

## Usage
To run the model, use the provided Jupyter notebook or execute the script directly if provided. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the correct path as required by the script or notebook.

## Evaluation

The performance of the diabetes prediction model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The overall percentage of correctly predicted cases.
- **Precision:** Measures how many of the predicted positive cases are actually positive.
- **Recall:** Indicates how well the model identifies actual positive cases.
- **F1 Score:** A balance between precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **ROC-AUC Score:** Assesses the model’s ability to differentiate between classes.

A confusion matrix was used to visualize the model’s performance, highlighting the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 

The models were also evaluated using K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure consistent performance across different subsets of the data, helping to prevent overfitting.

Overall, the model that balanced these metrics best was selected as the final model for diabetes prediction.
